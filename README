This Mancala Applet is written in Java and to be able to run on the internet requires that the security for applets to be turned off (for whatever site you use). Safari is a good browser option, as you can change the security preferences to allow certain sites. The Mancala Applet is currently being held at http://www.cs.middlebury.edu/~castiz/finalproject/Mancala.html.
